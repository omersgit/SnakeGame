# SnakeGame
Created Using Python
The project focuses on creating the Snake game. The snake's goal is to eat the food continuously and fill the map with its body as soon as possible. Originally, the project was written in Javascript. It has now been rewritten in Python for a user-friendly GUI and the simplicity in algorithm implementations.
